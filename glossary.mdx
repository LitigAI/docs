# A 

 

## Accuracy 

 

A measure that describes the proportion of correct and relevant results among the total number of tests conducted. In some cases, a response may be partially accurate and any accuracy measures should make it clear how accuracy is determined.  AI systems may also have different measures of Accuracy for different Use Cases. 

 

## Agents 

 

In the context of “Agentic AI”, agents refer to autonomous software components designed to perform specific tasks and make decisions without constant human intervention. There is a wide spectrum of agents and they are key to Agentic AI systems, which are capable of autonomous action, decision-making, and continuous learning from interactions. 

 

## Agentic AI 

 

A type of AI system that uses one or more “agents” and that can make decisions, initiate workflows, and otherwise act autonomously within defined parameters with limited human supervision. 

 

## AI Benchmarking 

 

The process of evaluating and comparing the performance of different AI systems or models to identify which performs best for specific tasks. 

 

## AI Ethics 

 

The issues that AI stakeholders such as engineers, businesses and governments must consider to ensure the technology is developed and used responsibly. This means adopting and implementing systems that support a safe, secure, unbiased, and environmentally friendly approach to artificial intelligence. 

 

## Algorithm 

 

A sequence of rules that a computer uses to complete a task. An algorithm takes an input (e.g., a dataset) and generates an output (e.g., a pattern that it has found in the data). 

 

## Algorithmic Bias 

 

Unfairness that can arise from problems with an algorithm’s process or the way the algorithm is implemented, resulting in the algorithm inappropriately privileging or disadvantaging one group of users over another group. Algorithmic biases often result from biases in the data that has been used to train the algorithm, which can lead to the reinforcement of systemic prejudices around race, gender, sexuality, disability or ethnicity. 

 

## Application Prompt 

 

Could be considered as a specific type of “System Prompt” tailored for a particular application or use case. It provides additional context or instructions specific to the task at hand, like “System Prompts” but with a narrower focus. 

 

## Artificial Intelligence 

 

The design and study of machines that can perform tasks that would previously have required human (or other biological) brainpower to accomplish. AI is a broad field that incorporates many different aspects of intelligence, such as reasoning, making decisions, identifying and classifying things, learning from mistakes, communicating, solving problems, and moving around the physical world. 

 

## Auditability

This capability enables the model to draw connections and transfer knowledge between modalities, enhancing its ability to perform tasks that require multi-modal understanding and interaction. 

 

# D 

 

## Data Bias 

 

Data bias refers to bias reflected in the data used to train machine learning (ML) models. Data bias can lead to ML models being trained to generate biased outputs and predictions. There are several potential sources of data bias including incomplete data, and data that reflects societal bias. 

 

## Data Cleaning 

 

A step in preparing the data used to train a machine learning (ML) model. Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors in the data. For example, fixing typing errors and removing duplicates in text data. 

 

## Data Scraping

## Deep Learning 

 

A form of machine learning that uses computational structures known as ‘neural networks’ to automatically recognise patterns in data and provide a suitable output, such as a prediction or evidence for a decision. Deep learning neural networks are loosely inspired by the way neurons in animal brains are organised, being composed of multiple layers of simple computational units (‘neurons’). 

 

# E 

 

## Embedding 

 

In the context of AI, embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or other pieces of data in a Vector Space. This allows AI systems to understand and process the semantic relationships between different pieces of information. By converting legal sources and documents into embeddings, AI systems can more effectively analyse contracts, monitor regulations, draft legal documents, and perform other tasks that require a deep understanding of legal terminology. 

 

## Error Rate
