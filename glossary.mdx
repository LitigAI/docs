# A

## Accuracy

A measure that describes the proportion of correct and relevant results among the total number of tests conducted. In some cases, a response may be partially accurate and any accuracy measures should make it clear how accuracy is determined.  AI systems may also have different measures of Accuracy for different Use Cases.

## Agentic AI

A type of AI system that can make decisions, initiate workflows, and otherwise act autonomously within defined parameters with limited human supervision.

## AI Benchmarking

The process of evaluating and comparing the performance of different AI systems or models to identify which performs best for specific tasks.

## AI Ethics

The issues that AI stakeholders such as engineers, businesses and governments must consider to ensure the technology is developed and used responsibly. This means adopting and implementing systems that support a safe, secure, unbiased, and environmentally friendly approach to artificial intelligence.

## Algorithm

A sequence of rules that a computer uses to complete a task. An algorithm takes an input (e.g., a dataset) and generates an output (e.g., a pattern that it has found in the data).

## Algorithmic Bias

Unfairness that can arise from problems with an algorithm’s process or the way the algorithm is implemented, resulting in the algorithm inappropriately privileging or disadvantaging one group of users over another group. Algorithmic biases often result from biases in the data that has been used to train the algorithm, which can lead to the reinforcement of systemic prejudices around race, gender, sexuality, disability or ethnicity.

## Artificial Intelligence

The design and study of machines that can perform tasks that would previously have required human (or other biological) brainpower to accomplish. AI is a broad field that incorporates many different aspects of intelligence, such as reasoning, making decisions, identifying and classifying things, learning from mistakes, communicating, solving problems, and moving around the physical world.

## Auditability

The ability to inspect and review the processes and outcomes of an AI system to ensure compliance with legal standards and ethical considerations. This includes being able to trace decisions back to their source data and logic, which is currently difficult with existing large language models.

## Automated decision-making

A process where decisions are made by machines or software algorithms without human intervention.

# B

## Backpropagation

A method used in training neural networks by adjusting weights based on the error from the output.

## Black Box

A system where the internal workings or decision-making processes are not transparent or easily understood.

# C

## Chatbot

A software application that is designed to imitate human conversation through a text, voice or video interface.

## Chain of Thought

A process of breaking down a complex query or task into simple steps, thereby allowing for improved logical reasoning, interpretability/explainability, and accuracy.

## Completions

The generated responses or outputs from a language model when given a prompt. For example, in response to the prompt "What is the capital of France?", the completion would be "Paris” or in relation to the prompt “Mary had a little” the completion would be “lamb”.

# D

## Data Bias

Data bias refers to bias reflected in the data used to train machine learning (ML) models. Data bias can lead to ML models being trained to generate biased outputs and predictions. There are several potential sources of data bias including incomplete data, and data that reflects societal bias.

## Data Cleaning

A step in preparing the data used to train a machine learning (ML) model. Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors in the data. For example, fixing typing errors and removing duplicates in text data.

## Data Scraping

The automated process of extracting and collecting information from websites or other digital sources for analysis or to train and test models.

## Dataset

A collection of data that AI systems use to learn, test, or validate outputs, decisions and predictions.

## Deep Learning

A form of machine learning that uses computational structures known as ‘neural networks’ to automatically recognise patterns in data and provide a suitable output, such as a prediction or evidence for a decision. Deep learning neural networks are loosely inspired by the way neurons in animal brains are organised, being composed of multiple layers of simple computational units (‘neurons’).

# E

## Embedding

In the context of AI, embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or other pieces of data in a Vector Space. This allows AI systems to understand and process the semantic relationships between different pieces of information. By converting legal sources and documents into embeddings, AI systems can more effectively analyse contracts, monitor regulations, draft legal documents, and perform other tasks that require a deep understanding of legal terminology.

## Error Rate

The proportion of all false or irrelevant outputs or predictions out of the total predictions made by the AI system, indicating the frequency of errors.

## Ethical AI

The practice of designing, developing, and deploying AI systems in a manner that aligns with widely accepted ethical principles, such as fairness, accountability, and respect for privacy.

## Explainability

The degree to which the internal mechanics of an AI or machine learning model can be explained in human terms. This is crucial for understanding how decisions are made.

# F

## F1-Score

A measure that combines Precision and Recall into a single metric by taking their harmonic mean, providing a single score to assess a model's accuracy.

## Few-shot Learning

A machine learning approach where a model is trained to recognise patterns or make decisions based on a very limited set of labelled data examples.

## Fine-tuning

The process of taking a pre-trained model (a model trained on a large dataset) and training it further on a smaller, specific dataset to adapt it for a particular task or to align with certain preferences.

## Foundation Model

A large-scale, pre-trained machine learning model that serves as a base and can be fine-tuned or adapted for various specific tasks or applications (eg; using prompt engineering or RAG).

# G

## Generalisation

The ability of a machine learning model to produce accurate predictions or outputs using new, unseen data.

## Guardrails

Restrictions and rules placed on AI systems to make sure they handle data appropriately and don't generate unethical content.

# H

## Hallucination

hallucination refers to instances where an AI system generates content that is factually incorrect, nonsensical, or entirely fabricated, despite appearing coherent and plausible at first glance. This phenomenon occurs because AI models, particularly large language models, generate responses based on statistical probabilities derived from their training data, rather than true understanding or reasoning capabilities. In legal applications, hallucinations can lead to significant risks, such as the introduction of incorrect legal information, misinterpretation of case law, or the inclusion of nonsensical clauses in legal documents.

## Human in The Loop (HITL)

A collaborative approach that combines human expertise and input with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems.

## Hyperparameter

A parameter, or value, which affects the way an AI model learns or the way an AI model behaves. These tend to be external configurations for a model that are set either before training or before deployment and are not learned from the data.
